### Hello! My name is Vinícius 😀🇧🇷

I'm a Brazilian front-end developer with experience in web development, specializing in React. In addition to working with web development, I also dedicate myself to UI design.<br>

To improve my skills, I stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies in web development by consistently exploring new updates and libraries related to the JavaScript ecosystem.<br>

I highlight my experiences by presenting specific projects where I applied my web development skills. My portfolio reflects the challenges faced in each project and the solutions I implemented.<br>

Additionally, I have experience as a front-end developer, demonstrating effective communication, teamwork and organizational skills.<br>

I actively seek opportunities, with the aim of contributing significantly to challenging projects and learning more and more.<br>
